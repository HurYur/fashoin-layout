			<p>Not just the mere external "seen" aspects of beauty,<br /> but most of all, the internal "unseen" components.<br />
			Scott Westerfeld put it this way:</p>
			<h2>"What you do, the way you think,<br /> makes you beautiful."</h2>

			<div class="bord-box">
				<p>In other words: being the best version of yourself (mentally, physically, financially, relationally, spiritually) is true beauty.  There is little beauty or honor in trying to be someone else or living with untapped potential or settling for a life of mediocrity. And yet, as Thoreau reminds us that many who live quiet lives of desperation. That is, they just exist from day to day by playing small or living vicariously through others or playing it safe.</p>
